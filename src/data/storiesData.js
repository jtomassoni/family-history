    title: "The Tomassoni Family History",

    content: `Guido Tomassoni (my Dad) was born in Costaciaro, Italy on April 20, 1890. Children in his family consisted of Egisto (the oldest), Luigi (called Pilo), Guido (Guy), Teresa, and Valeria. His parents' names were Biaggo and Francesca.

Dad came to America in 1907 at age 17. He came with his brother Pilo and his sister Teresa. They came to Hibbing, Minnesota because their older brother Egisto was already here. Egisto had come to America in 1905 and was working in the underground mines. Dad and Pilo also went to work in the underground mines.

Dad's sister Teresa married Nazzareno Gambucci. They had 5 children: Charlie, Gino, Lena, Nello, and Dino. Charlie and Gino were hockey players. Charlie played for the U.S. Olympic team in 1948. Gino played for the Chicago Blackhawks.

Dad's sister Valeria stayed in Italy. She married and had 3 children: Aldo, Lena, and Gina. Aldo became a priest and served in Rome. Lena and Gina married and had families in Italy.

In 1915, Dad went back to Italy to serve in World War I. He was in the Italian Army for 4 years. After the war, he returned to Hibbing and continued working in the mines.

Dad met my mother, Mary Primavera, at a dance in Hibbing. They were married on November 27, 1920. They had four children: John (me), Robert, Richard, and Mary Louise.

We lived in Brooklyn Location until I was 5 years old. Then we moved to Park Addition where Dad and Uncle Charlie Gambucci opened a grocery store. The store was called "Tomassoni & Gambucci Grocery." It was located on the corner of 1st Avenue and 25th Street.

Dad worked hard all his life to provide for his family. He was proud to be an American citizen and taught us to appreciate the opportunities this country offered. He passed away on December 15, 1965, at age 75.`,

    title: "Life in Brooklyn",
    date: "Early 1920s",
    content: `Brooklyn was a small community located on the east side of Hibbing with homes, a school, and a few businesses (most of the businesses are gone now). This is where I was born (June 14, 1925, about 7 AM).

Our house was located on Pine Street, which was a dirt road at that time. The house was small but comfortable, with two bedrooms, a living room, kitchen, and an outhouse in the back. We had a large garden where we grew vegetables, and Mom canned everything she could for the winter months.

I remember the Brooklyn School. It was a two-story wooden building with four classrooms. Each room had a pot-bellied stove for heat. The teachers were strict but fair. We walked to school every day, about half a mile each way.

There was Dougherty's Store where we bought penny candy and basic groceries. Next to it was Cappo's Bar where the miners would gather after their shifts. The Brooklyn Hall was where community events were held - dances, weddings, and holiday celebrations.

The mines were always present in our lives. You could hear the whistles marking the shift changes, and the ground would sometimes shake from the underground blasting. Many of our neighbors worked in the mines, including my father and uncles.

We had no indoor plumbing or electricity at first. Water came from a pump in the yard, and we used kerosene lamps for light. In winter, we'd bring in blocks of ice from the lake and store them in sawdust to keep food cold.

The neighborhood was like one big family. Everyone knew each other and helped out when needed. The women would share recipes and watch each other's children. The men would help with house repairs and garden work.

I remember the sounds of different languages - Italian, Slovenian, Croatian, Finnish - as the immigrants from various countries made Brooklyn their home. We learned bits and pieces of each other's languages and customs.

Life was simple but good in Brooklyn. We didn't have much money, but we always had enough to eat, thanks to Mom's garden and Dad's steady work in the mines. The community spirit made up for what we lacked in material things.`,

    title: "Life in Park Addition",
    date: "1930s",
    content: `We moved to Park Addition when I was 5 years oldâ€”1930. I guess Dad was tired of on/off work in the underground mines, so he joined with Uncle Charlie Gambucci to become a businessman.

The store was called Tomassoni & Gambucci Grocery. It was located on the corner of First Avenue and 25th Street. The building had the store on the first floor and living quarters upstairs where we lived. The store had wooden floors that had to be sprinkled with sawdust and swept every day.

The store sold groceries, fresh meat (Dad was the butcher), fresh fruits and vegetables, and other household items. We also delivered groceries to customers' homes. I remember helping with deliveries using our delivery truck.

Park Addition was a lively neighborhood. Most of the residents were Italian immigrants or first-generation Italian-Americans. The streets were always full of kids playing games like kick-the-can, hide and seek, and baseball.

We had the Memorial Building nearby where we'd go swimming and play basketball. The Park Theater was where we'd watch movies on Saturday afternoons. Admission was 10 cents, and popcorn was 5 cents.

The neighborhood had several other businesses: Valentini's Restaurant, Sergio's Barbershop, Vitali's Bakery, and the Park Drug Store. Each place had its own character and regular customers.

School was at Washington Elementary, which was much bigger than the Brooklyn School. We walked to school year-round, even in the bitter cold Minnesota winters. The school had steam heat, indoor plumbing, and electricity - all luxuries compared to our old school.

Life revolved around family, church, and community. St. James Catholic Church was the center of many activities. We had Sunday Mass, catechism classes, and various social events. The church basement was where many wedding receptions and community gatherings were held.

Dad and Uncle Charlie worked long hours in the store, often from 7 AM to 9 PM. Mom helped in the store too, while also taking care of us kids and maintaining our home upstairs. Despite the long hours, they always made time for family meals and Sunday gatherings.

Growing up in Park Addition taught us the value of hard work, family loyalty, and community spirit. These lessons have stayed with me throughout my life.`,

    title: "The Story of John and Marian Tomassoni",
    date: "1950s",
    content: `My name is Marian Therese Primavera Tomassoni. I am the wife of John Edward Tomassoni. I plan to tell the story of John's and my heritage and our lives before we married.

I met John at a dance at the Memorial Building in Hibbing. He was home on leave from the Navy during World War II. We started dating whenever he was home on leave. After the war, when John returned home permanently, we continued dating and were married on June 14, 1947.

We started our married life in an apartment above the family store in Park Addition. John worked with his father in the grocery store while attending Hibbing Junior College. Later, he went to the University of Minnesota to study education.

Our first child, John Jr., was born in 1948. Mary followed in 1950, and David in 1952. We moved to our own home on 25th Street, just a few blocks from the store. The house needed work, but John spent evenings and weekends fixing it up.

John became a teacher at Hibbing High School, teaching business education. I stayed home with the children but was active in church and community activities. We maintained close ties with both the Tomassoni and Primavera families, with frequent Sunday dinners and holiday gatherings.

Our children grew up surrounded by family, just as we had. They played with their cousins, learned to help in the store, and absorbed the values of hard work and family loyalty that had been passed down through generations.

Life wasn't always easy, but we faced challenges together. The mining industry's ups and downs affected everyone in Hibbing, but the strong community spirit helped people get through tough times. We learned to appreciate what we had and to help others when we could.

Looking back, I'm grateful for the life we built together. Our Italian heritage, our faith, our family, and our community have given us a rich and meaningful life. These are the stories and values we hope to pass on to our children and grandchildren.`,
